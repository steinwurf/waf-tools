Steinwurf uses `Waf`_ to build all the build system. This repository contains a
set of Waf tools.
These tools enable the Steinwurf software libraries to be built with a wide
range of compilers on various platforms. Furthermore special runner tools allow
unit tests to be executed directly on external target devices.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this library, please contact
us at our developer mailing list (hosted at Google Groups):
