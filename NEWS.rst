News for waf-tools
==================

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list
of every change, see the Git log.

Latest
------
* Minor: Added wurf_android_soname.py. For Android builds sets the soname of the
  shared libraries built to the library name itself.

3.11.0
------
* Minor: Added mkspecs for g++ 5.4.

3.10.1
------
* Patch: Fixed the test_files property in wurf_runner, so that the input files
  are always located in the source folder. Previously the files in the build
  folder had priority, and these files might be out-of-date.

3.10.0
------
* Minor: Added the cxx_android_gxx49_armv7, cxx_android5_gxx49_armv7,
  cxx_android_clang38_armv7, cxx_android5_clang38_armv7 mkspecs to support
  g++ 4.9 and clang 3.8 in the Android NDK r12b. The clang mkspecs are still
  experimental: runtime failures are expected when using std::thread.

3.9.0
-----
* Minor: Added the cxx_raspberry_gxx49_armv7 mkspec (for Raspberry Pi 2)

3.8.1
-----
* Patch: Fixed invalid parameter in mkspec_setup_gcov.

  version is used first.

3.7.0
-----
* Minor: Added mkspecs for clang 3.6 sanitizers.

3.6.1
-----
* Patch: Added the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 define in clang_common to fix
  linking issues with clang on recent Linux systems where libstdc++ has an
  incompatible dual ABI.

3.6.0
-----
* Minor: Added mkspecs for clang 3.8, g++ 6.0 and g++ 6.1.

3.5.1
-----
* Patch: Use the /Z7 flag for MSVC debug builds to include all debugging
  information in the .obj files.

3.5.0
-----
* Minor: Re-enabled the -O2 flag on OSX. This produces 15x faster code for
  the binary field.

-----
* Patch: The test runner supports utf-8 characters printed on stdout/stderr.

3.4.0
-----
* Minor: Added mkspecs for clang 3.7 and g++ 5.3.
